# DeepScribe Clinical Trial Matcher

A full-stack application that matches simplified patient summaries to clinical trials using modern web technologies and LLMs.

---

## Overview of Approach

This application allows users to input free-text patient summaries. The backend uses an AI model to extract key clinical details (e.g., condition, location, age, gender) and then queries the ClinicalTrials.gov database to find relevant matches.

Users can:
- See simplified summaries of clinical trials.
- Filter by recruitment status.
- Bookmark trials locally in their browser for later review.
---
- **Frontend**: React + Material UI  
- **Backend**: FastAPI  
- **AI**: Uses OpenAI to extract patient information and simplify trial summaries
